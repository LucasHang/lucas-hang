    "presentation": "Over the years, my knowledge increased mostly in a self-taught way. At age 18 I had my first professional opportunity, two years focused in learning and evolution. At age 21 I became Scrum Master, a challenge that has proven to be fortuitous and has brought me closer to Leadership, which I intend to evolve from now on. A diversity of technologies and frameworks I learned, but more valuable than that, communication, responsibility and trust. I know I can bring more knowledge and also learn from my peers. I do so that the product I work on is resilient, valued and safe.",
